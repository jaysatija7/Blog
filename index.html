<h2>Strengthening Vigilance to Combat Deadly Coronavirus!</h2>
<div>It has been 4-5 months since the whole world has taken a pause as if this earth has stopped its revolution. Every single human life is at the risk of getting infected from the virus and social distancing can be regarded as the need of the hour. What we need to convey is that AI is acting as the brawns and brains of humankind during this coronavirus outbreak. Computer Vision is also a bifurcation of AI and we can harness it for social distancing. For example, it can be used to automate the identification and detection of pedestrians, infected patients, and traffic across cities.</div>
<div>There is a very famous movie directed by Justin Baldoni, titled “Five Feet Apart”. If you have seen it, then you will certainly realize that this concept is going to be implemented soon. We might see people following the rule of maintaining a distance of five feet from each other. In this blog, we will see how computer vision can be used for enforcing social distancing along with other protective measures.</div>

<h3>Social Distancing: Need of the Hour</h3>
<div>Social Distancing has emerged as the only way to tackle this blood-thirsting virus. In India, our honorable PM has already stated that people have to learn to live with this virus while maintaining at least 6 feet of distance to avoid congestion in public places. According to a research study conducted by Harvard University, the world will be able to flatten the pandemic curve through social distancing only. It requires immense support from the public and vigilant administration. The latter can be achieved through Computer Vision. Let’s see how.</div>
<h3>Computer Vision Enforcing Social Distancing</h3>
<div>We can effectively monitor public spaces through cameras and sensors to track social distancing and impose strict rules and regulations for those who violate its norms. Deep Learning Algorithms have made the analysis of video feeds collected from different corners of a metropolitan city easy for tracking traffic and pedestrian congestion.</div>
<div>Researchers at John Hopkins University stated that computer vision gives us ammunition to fight this virus in ways we never thought before. Deep Neural Networks can process trillions of GBs of data and several countries are now turning towards AI-driven solutions to emerge victorious out of this battle.</div>
<div>Awareness chatbots, location trackers, contactless screening, and thermal imaging systems are some of the examples in which computer vision techniques can be employed to bring this ineluctable virus to its knees.</div>
<div id="ka">At Kolkata Airport, Computer Vision techniques have successfully deployed to set up a new passenger protocol, including compulsory thermal screening, no-contact ID card verification, and boarding pass scanning.</div>
<h3>Image and Video Analytics</h3>
<div>At airports and railway stations, computer vision cameras can be installed to collect data regarding passengers. We can then monitor the forehead temperatures of passengers without manual screening methods. Computer Vision combines RGB and thermal imaging to measure body temperature and alert officials if it finds something abnormal. On the same lines, data analysts are training deep learning models to identify excessive pedestrian flow at public places.</div>

<h3>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Technology</h3>
<div>As already evident from the NEWS, drones have proved of utmost importance in these difficult times. To mitigate virus transmission, computer vision techniques are efficient at automating drones to extract useful insights and take necessary actions. UAVs can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Delivering emergency food supplies and testing kits.</li>
	<li>Spraying disinfectant for sanitization of public places.</li>
	<li>Detecting unmasked citizens through cameras.</li>
	<li>Communicating advisory through speakers.</li>
	<li>Analyzing the movement of people in quarantine shelters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Computer Vision for Workplace Safety</h3>
<div>The count of companies building AI-powered tools to implement social distancing and other preventive measures in the workplace is increasing day-by-day. With uncertainty about proper vaccines and therapies in hand, behavioral conduct can be the only way around. Computer Vision plays a crucial role in enforcing social distancing at the workplace. For example, companies can install thermal imaging systems at the entry point, bring virtualization on the ground, ensure separate space for an individual employee, etc.</div>
<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
<div>There is no doubt that emerging technologies like machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence can cast a beam of light over this shattered world to get relief from the COVID-19 pandemic. While we wait for the ultimate arrival of a vaccine, computer vision techniques can be deployed to avoid the potential spread of the virus by minimizing physical contact. It now rests on our shoulders to adopt what’ best for us!</div>
